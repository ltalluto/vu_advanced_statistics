* In the Zombie example, we knew the probability of being a zombie: $p_z = 0.3$

## Parameter estimation in Stan

* Stan is a modelling language for scientific computing
* We use *probabilistic programming*
   - deterministic variables: `a = b * c`
   - Stochastic variables: `y ~ normal(mu, sigma)`

### Workflow

1. Write a Stan model in a `.stan` file
2. Prepare all data in R
3. Use the `rstan` package to invoke the Stan interpreter
   - Translates your model into a C++ program then compiles for your computer
4. Run the program from R using functions in the `rstan` package.


## Parameter estimation in Stan

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
* All Stan programs need a `data` block where you define any input data for your model
	- Variables must have a **type**
	- Here, `int` indicates a variable that is an integer
	- **Constraints** give rules about variables; here k must be positive, and n >= k

## Why Bayes?
* I want to describe some phenomenon ("model"; $\theta$)
* I have some general ("prior") knowledge about the question: $pr(\theta)$
* I gather additional information ("data"; $X$)

What is the probability that my model is correct given what I already know about it and what I’ve learned?

$$ pr(\theta | X) $$

## Applying Bayes' Theorem

* We already know an expression for this:

$$
pr(\theta | X) = \frac{pr(X|\theta)pr(\theta)}{pr(X)}
$$

## Applying Bayes' Theorem

* We already know an expression for this:

$$
pr(\theta | X) = \frac{pr(X|\theta)pr(\theta)}{pr(X)}
$$

* The goal, $pr(\theta | X)$, is called the **posterior probability of $\theta$**
* We have already seen $pr(X|\theta)$; this is the **likelihood** of the data
* $pr(\theta)$ is often called the **prior probability of $\theta$**. Could also be called "other information about $\theta$"
* What about $pr(X)$? This is the **normalizing constant**

When we do Bayesian inference, each of these terms is a full **probability distribution**


## The normalizing constant

> - For the first zombie problem, we had a single observation ("I tested positive"), we were able to add up all of the ways one could test positive.
> - $pr(T) = pr(T,Z) + pr(T,Z') = pr(T|Z)pr(Z) + pr(T|Z')pr(Z')$
> - $pr(X) = \sum_i^n pr(X|\theta_i)pr(\theta_i)$ where all possible models are in the set $n$
> - What about for continuous problems?



## The normalizing constant

* For the first zombie problem, we had a single observation ("I tested positive"), we were able to add up all of the ways one could test positive.
* $pr(T) = pr(T,Z) + pr(T,Z') = pr(T|Z)pr(Z) + pr(T|Z')pr(Z')$
* $pr(X) = \sum_i^n pr(X|\theta_i)pr(\theta_i)$ where all possible models are in the set $n$
* What about for continuous problems? 
    - There are an infinite number of possible models if $pr(\theta)$ is a continuous PDF.
    - There are infinitely many possible datasets if X is real-valued



## The normalizing constant

* For the first zombie problem, we had a single observation ("I tested positive"), we were able to add up all of the ways one could test positive.
* $pr(T) = pr(T,Z) + pr(T,Z') = pr(T|Z)pr(Z) + pr(T|Z')pr(Z')$
* $pr(X) = \sum_i^n pr(X|\theta_i)pr(\theta_i)$ where all possible models are in the set $n$
* What about for continuous problems? 
    - There are an infinite number of possible models if $pr(\theta)$ is a continuous PDF.
    - There are infinitely many possible datasets if X is real-valued

$$
pr(X) = \int_a^b pr(X|\theta)pr(\theta)d \theta
$$

* This integral can be challenging to compute


## Proportional Bayes' Theorem

> - $pr(X)$ is a *constant*; it adjusts the height of the distribution so that the posterior integrates to 1
> - If all we want to do is estimate the maximum value, we can safely ignore it

## Proportional Bayes' Theorem

* $pr(X)$ is a *constant*; it adjusts the height of the distribution so that the posterior integrates to 1
* If all we want to do is estimate the maximum value, we can safely ignore it

$$
pr(\theta|X) \propto pr(X|\theta)pr(\theta)
$$

* For our example, we used the binomial PMF for the likelihood:

$$
pr(X|\theta) = pr(k,n|p) = {n \choose k} p^k(1-p)^{(n-k)}
$$

How to choose the prior, $pr(\theta)$?

* If we just want a Bayesian point estimate for $\theta$, we can use the same algorithms for MLE
