## Why Bayes?

Why statistics at all? What is the goal of statistical analysis?

>- I want to describe some phenomenon (“model”)
>- I have some general (“prior”) knowledge about the question
>- I gather additional information (“data”)

## Why Bayes?

Why statistics at all? What is the goal of statistical analysis?

* I want to describe some phenomenon (“model”)
* I have some general (“prior”) knowledge about the question
* I gather additional information (“data”)

<br/>
<br/>
What is the probability that my model is correct given what I already know about it and what I’ve learned?

**Are you a (latent) zombie?**

**The problem**:

People are turning into zombies! We have a test, but it is imperfect, with a *false positive rate* = 1% and a *false negative rate* = 0.5%.

You take the test, and the result is positive. What is the probability that you are actually going to become a zombie?

## Is probability the same as frequency?

* You took the zombie test, the result is positive ($T$). we want to know $pr(Z|T)$
* We already know $pr(T|Z) = 0.99$: this is the *true positive rate*
* We could use this along with **statistical decision theory** to make a decision about our status
* So what's our null hypothesis?

Let's add some information: We also learn that 0.1% of the population is infected.

### Hints
* Define the partitions:
   - Zombie ($Z$) or not a zombie ($'Z = 1 - Z$)
   - Positive test ($T$) or negative test ($'T = 1 - T$)
* Assign known numbers to statements of **joint**, **marginal**, or **conditional** probabilities
* Compute unknowns using the conditional probability rule: $pr(A,B) = pr(A|B)pr(B)$
* Assign concrete numbers: imagine testing 1,000,000 people. How many are zombies? How many test positive? How many test positive and are zombies?

## Is probability the same as frequency?

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
* You took the zombie test, the result is positive ($T$). we want to know $pr(Z|T)$
* We already know $pr(T|Z) = 0.99$: this is the *true positive rate*
* We could use this along with **statistical decision theory** to make a decision about our status
* So what's our null hypothesis?
	- $H_0$: I am not a zombie! ($Z'$)
	- $H_A$: I am a zombie! ($Z$)
* According to the *false positive rate*
	- $pr(T|Z') = 1 - pr(T|Z) = 0.01$
	- $p < 0.05$
	- Conclusion: Reject $H_0$, I must be a zombie

## Distribution functions

* A **probability density function** (PDF) is a function f(x) that:
    - is defined on an interval [a,b] (may be infinite)
    - is positive
    - is regular---one value of f(x) for every value of (x), and $\frac{df(x)}{dx}$ is finite
    - $\int_a^b f(x)dx = 1$
    - `d` functions in R (probability **d**ensity) -- `dnorm`, `dgamma`, etc
    - For discrete distributions, called a **probability mass function** (PMF)
* Every PDF/PMF has a CDF
    - $F(x) = \int_a^x f(x)dx$
    - The probability of a value between $a$ and $x$
