For this exercise, you will use the `birddiv.csv` dataset, available under "Data" on OLAT. Bird diversity was measured in 1-km^2 plots in multiple countries of Europe, investigating the effects of habitat fragmentation and productivity on diversity. We will consider a subset of the data. Specificially, we will ask how various covariates are associated with the diversity of birds specializing on different habitat types. The data have the following potential predictors:

* **Grow.degd**: growing degree days, a proxy for how warm the climate is.
* **For.cover**: Forest cover near the sampling location
* **NDVI**: normalized difference vegetation index, a proxy for productivity
* **For.diver**: Forest diversity in the forested area nearby
* **Agr.diver**: Diversity of agricultural landscapes
* **For.fragm**: Index of forest fragmentation

All of the above variables are standardized to a 0-100 scale. Consider this when choosing priors.

Your response variable will be **richness**, the bird species richness in the plot. Additionally, you have an indicator variable **hab_type**. This is not telling you what habitat type was sampled (plots included multiple habitats). Rather, this is telling you what type of bird species were counted for the richness measurement: so `hab_type == "forest" & richness == 7` indicates that 7 forest specialists were observed in that plot.

Build one or more generalised linear models for bird richness. Your task should be to describe two things: (1) how does richness vary with climate, productivity, fragmentation, or habitat diversity, and (2) do these relationships vary depending on what habitat bird species specialize on. At a minimum:

1. Explore the data visually.
2. Choose an appropriate liklihood distribution and link function (or, if unsure, try several and compare)
3. Decide on appropriate predictors, then write out the model equations, and draw a graph of the model.
4. Write a function in r for the log posterior
5. Produce samples from the model, using either Laplace approximation or MCMC. If you want to use MCMC, you will need to implement a multivariate sampler, or use the sample one provided in `r/mh.r`.
6. Interpret the results using the tools we've covered so far. Some possibilities:
    a. Credible intervals for parameters
    b. Posterior predictive intervals
    c. Response curves (How does E(y) respond to the change in a parameter *conditional on other parameters*)

**Note**: it is not necessary to do a model selection procedure to choose your predictors (we will cover this later). Choose predictors based on what sub-questions interest you most, or what you think will be most impactful.
