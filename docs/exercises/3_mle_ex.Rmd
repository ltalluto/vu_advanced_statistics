```

Load the tsuga dataset from this repository.

```{r}
library(data.table)
tsuga = readRDS("data/tsuga.rds")
```

This dataset gives statistics about *Tsuga canadensis* observed over multiple years in forest plots in eastern Canada. Included are the number of trees `born`, the number observed to have `died` that year, the total number of trees (including dead ones) `n`, and the climate.

1. Filter the dataset so that it contains only observations from the year 2005 with at least 1 individual (`n > 0`)
2. Write a function taking three parametrs:
   a. `p`: a *single value*, the probability that a randomly chosen individual is dead
   b. `n`: a *vector*, the number of trees in each plot
   c. `k`: a *vetor*, the number of dead trees in each plot
   d. The function should return the *log likelihood*: $\log pr(n,k|p)$
```{r}
# n and k are vectors
lfun = function(p, n, k) {
   ## function body
   return() ## a single value!
}
```

   
3. Plot the log likelihood across various values of `p`
4. Use `optim` to find the MLE for `p`
5. Is the answer different from `mean(dat$died/dat$n)`? If so, why?
6. Repeat the above, but this time estimate the **mean number** of trees per plot.
    a. What is an appropriate likelihood function?
    b. What is the MLE?
    c. How does the MLE compare to `mean(dat$n)`?
7. Use the MLE and the `r****()` function corresponding to the likelihood function to simulate a new dataset, with as many observations as in the original data.
   a. Compare a histogram and summary statistics of your simulated data with the real data. Note any similarities and differences?
   b. Consider how you could improve this **generative model** to better describe the dataset. Do you need a new likelihood function?
