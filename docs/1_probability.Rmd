## Course Introduction

> - Introduce ourselves - name, research area, what you want from this course
> - The [course web page](https://mtalluto.github.io/vu_advanced_statistics/) has links to all code and presentations



## Why Bayes?
>- Why statistics? What is the goal of statistical analysis?



## Why Bayes?
>- I want to describe some phenomenon (“model”)
>- I have some general (“prior”) knowledge about the question
>- I gather additional information (“data”)

## Why Bayes?
* I want to describe some phenomenon (“model”)
* I have some general (“prior”) knowledge about the question
* I gather additional information (“data”)

<br/>
<br/>
What is the probability that my model is correct given what I already know about it and what I’ve learned?

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
Imagine a box with a total area of 1, representing all possible events
</div>

* An event A has some probability of occurring: *pr(A)*
* A second event, B, has multiple possible relationships to A:
  - If A and B never occur together, the events are **disjoint**
  - If the two overlap, we can say that they **intersect**
* pr(A) + pr(B) = the chance of *at least one event*
* pr(A,B) = the probability of both (**joint probability**)
  - Also written $A \cap B$ (the intersection of A and B)
* pr(A) + pr(B) - pr(A,B) is the *union* ($A \cup B$)

</div>

## Independence

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
* A and B are independent if pr(A) is not influenced by whether B has occurred, and vice-versa
* $pr(A,B) = pr(A)pr(B)$ (**joint probability**)
* $pr(A|B) = pr(A)$
* $pr(B|A) = pr(B)$

## Conditional probability
<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
* $pr(A|B)$ is the probability that $A$ occurs, given that we already know $B$ has occurred
* We notate the opposite (pr that $A$ occurs given that $B$ has not): $pr(A|'B)$
* We can define conditional probabilities in terms of **joint** and **marginal** probabilities

$$pr(A,B) = pr(A|B)pr(B)$$
</div>

## Manipulating conditional probabilities

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
**Are you a (latent) zombie?**

**The problem**:<br />
0.1% of the population is infected with a parasite that will turn them into zombies. We have a test, but it is imperfect, with a *false negative rate* = 0.5% and a *false positive rate* = 1%. 

You take the test, and the result is positive. What is the probability that you are actually going to become a zombie?

**Hints**

* Define the partitions:
   - Zombie ($Z$) or not a zombie ($'Z = 1 - Z$)
   - Positive test ($T$) or negative test ($'T = 1 - T$)
* Assign known numbers to statements of **joint**, **marginal**, or **conditional** probabilities
* Compute unknowns using the conditional probability rule: $pr(A,B) = pr(A|B)pr(B)$
* Assign concrete numbers: imagine testing 1,000,000 people. How many are zombies? How many test positive? How many test positive and are zombies?
